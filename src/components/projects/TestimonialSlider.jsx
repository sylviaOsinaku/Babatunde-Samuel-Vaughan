    testimony: "I have known Babatunde for more than seven years and all through that time one thing has remained consistent about him - his insatiable hunger to improve people, his community and the world. Babatunde leverages his skills in Tech and his passion for Social Development to groom young leaders, champion community impact and help companies attain the highest standard possible. I have seen him do many things over the years but specific things I realize he excels at are in designing programs, inspiring people to achieve great impact, thinking strategically and birthing innovative developments across diverse sectors. Babatunde is that utility player every organization need to ignite possibilities and break new grounds. Anyone would feel blessed to have Babatunde in their team.",

    testimony: "If I had an impossible deadline for a mission-critical project that involved digital transformation within the education industry vertical and I could only hire one person, Babatunde would be that person! In fact, we were in exactly that position when my account executive left Microsoft to pursue his passions in the humanitarian sector. I called on Babatunde to do the impossible and he never questioned the requirement but worked night and day doing some of the most creative and productive work that I have seen in 20+ years in the IT industry! He has it all - brilliant mind, trustworthy, very solid work ethic. I recommend him without reservation and hope to have the opportunity to work with him again!",
