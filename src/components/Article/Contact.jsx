In fact, we were in exactly that position when my account executive left Microsoft to pursue his passions in the humanitarian sector. I called on Babatunde to do the impossible and he never questioned the requirement but worked night and day doing some of the most creative and productive work that I have seen in 20+ years in the IT industry! He has it all - brilliant mind, trustworthy, very solid work ethic. I recommend him without reservation and hope to have the opportunity to work with him again!",
